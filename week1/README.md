# 🚀 Week 1: My AI/ML Transition Journey  

This marks the **completion of my first week** in transitioning toward a career in **AI/ML**.  
In Week 1, I focused on building foundations and applying them through **two classic datasets**:

## 📂 Datasets Explored  
1. **Classification Problem – Titanic Dataset**  
   - Predicting passenger survival based on features like age, class, and gender.  
   - [Notebook → Titanic Classification](./titanicExploration.ipynb)  

2. **Regression Problem – Housing Prices**  
   - Predicting house prices using numerical and categorical features.  
   - [Notebook → Housing Regression](./hosuingPrice.ipynb)
